# Commit or Rewrite Action

A smart GitHub Action that creates new commits or amends existing ones based on commit IDs. Perfect for automated commits that should update in-place rather than creating new commits every time.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Feature: Smart Amending

This action intelligently decides whether to create a new commit or amend an existing one:

- **First run**: Creates a new commit with your specified ID
- **Subsequent runs with same ID**: If HEAD commit has the same ID, it amends that commit
- **Different ID or no matching ID**: Creates a new commit

This prevents commit spam from automated tasks while maintaining a clean git history!

### How It Works

1. Each commit includes a git trailer: `X-Commit-Rewrite-ID: <your-id>`
2. When the action runs, it checks if HEAD has this exact trailer
3. **If HEAD has matching ID** â†’ Amends that commit
4. **If HEAD has different/no ID** â†’ Creates a new commit

**Important**: The amend ONLY happens when the HEAD commit has the matching ID. If there are other commits on top, a new commit will be created.

**Technical Note**: This action doesn't use `git commit --amend`. Instead, it uses the GitHub API to rewrite commits, which is why we call it "pseudo-amend" internally. From a user perspective, it works just like amending.

## âœ¨ Automatic Commit Signing

All commits are created via GitHub API, which provides automatic signing:
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** (default): Signed by GitHub Actions bot
- **GitHub App tokens**: Signed by your GitHub App
- **Fine-grained PATs**: Signed by the token owner

No GPG key configuration required - commits appear as "Verified" automatically!

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```yaml
- name: Update generated files
  uses: actionutils/commit-or-amend@v1
  with:
    commit_message: 'chore: update generated files'
    id: 'generated-files-update'
    # Branch is auto-detected if not specified
```

Running this multiple times will keep amending the same commit as long as it's the HEAD commit.

### Specific Files

```yaml
- name: Update changelog
  uses: actionutils/commit-or-amend@v1
  with:
    commit_message: 'docs: update changelog'
    id: 'changelog-auto-update'
    files: |
      CHANGELOG.md
      docs/releases.md
```

### With Custom Branch

```yaml
- name: Update on specific branch
  uses: actionutils/commit-or-amend@v1
  with:
    commit_message: 'chore: automated update'
    id: 'auto-update'
    branch: 'automation-branch'
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_APP_TOKEN }}
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `commit_message` | Commit message (can be multiline) | Yes | - |
| `id` | Unique identifier for amending | Yes | - |
| `branch` | Target branch (auto-detects if not specified) | No | `''` (auto-detect) |
| `files` | Files to commit (newline-separated). If empty, commits all changes | No | `''` (all changes) |
| `github_token` | GitHub token for API operations | No | `${{ github.token }}` |

## Real-World Examples

### Automated Dependency Updates

```yaml
name: Update Dependencies
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * MON'  # Every Monday
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2  # Need HEAD and its parent for amending

      - name: Update npm dependencies
        run: |
          npx npm-check-updates -u
          npm install

      - name: Commit updates
        uses: actionutils/commit-or-amend@v1
        with:
          commit_message: 'chore: weekly dependency update'
          id: 'npm-deps-weekly'
          files: |
            package.json
            package-lock.json
```

Running this workflow multiple times in the same week will amend the same commit instead of creating multiple "weekly update" commits.

### Generated Documentation

```yaml
name: Generate Docs
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['src/**']

jobs:
  docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2

      - name: Generate API docs
        run: npm run generate-docs

      - name: Update docs
        uses: actionutils/commit-or-amend@v1
        with:
          commit_message: 'docs: auto-generated API documentation'
          id: 'api-docs-auto'
          files: 'docs/api/'
```

### Build Artifacts

```yaml
- name: Build and commit dist
  run: npm run build

- name: Commit built files
  uses: actionutils/commit-or-amend@v1
  with:
    commit_message: 'build: update dist files'
    id: 'build-dist'
    files: 'dist/'
```

## When Does Amending Happen?

Amending **ONLY** occurs when:
1. The HEAD commit has the trailer `X-Commit-Rewrite-ID: <your-id>`
2. You run the action with the same `id` value

Amending **DOES NOT** occur when:
- HEAD commit has a different ID
- HEAD commit has no ID trailer
- There are other commits after the commit with matching ID

This ensures predictable behavior and prevents accidental rewrites of unrelated commits.

## Implementation Details

Unlike `git commit --amend`, this action uses the GitHub API to create commits. When amending:
1. It resets the branch to the parent commit using the API
2. Creates a new commit with updated content
3. The result looks exactly like an amended commit

This approach allows for signed commits without requiring GPG keys and works seamlessly in GitHub Actions environments.

## Why Use This Action?

### Without This Action
- Multiple automated commits clutter history
- "Update dependencies" Ã— 10 commits
- Manual squashing/rebasing needed
- Complex GPG setup for verified commits

### With This Action
- âœ… Clean history with automatic amending
- âœ… Automatic verified/signed commits
- âœ… No commit spam from automation
- âœ… No GPG configuration needed
- âœ… Predictable amend behavior

## Requirements

- The workflow must have write permissions to the repository (`contents: write`)
- When using custom tokens:
  - Fine-grained PATs: Need `contents: write` permission
  - GitHub Apps: Need `contents: write` permission
  - Classic PATs: Need `repo` scope

## Future Features

We're considering adding support for:
- `fixup` commits for later squashing
- `squash` operations for combining commits
- Custom trailer keys
